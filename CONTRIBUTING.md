# Contributing

We will start accepting contributions once we have the necessary infrastructure
set up.

## Dependencies

You will need the following installed:

1. node.js
2. yarn

## Running

1. Install dependencies
2. Run the data server
3. `yarn start`

You will need to host your own data server. This is relatively simple.

1. Clone the data repository
2. Install http-server
3. Run http-server in the data directory under port `8000`
